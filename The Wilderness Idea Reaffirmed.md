The Wilderness Idea Reaffirmed

Abstract~ The concept of wildernessis coherent and vital for the protection of intrinsic natural values. Wild nature diffen from human culture  in radical ways. To suppose that humans can improve spontaneous wild nature deliberately is a contradiction in terms. Kind~ or biodivenity  can be protected by wilderness designation that are protected doubtfully by rural indigenous peoples. American landscapes.Though Mlrnetimes  affected by the aboriginal inhabitants. were not modified 50 dramatically orirrevenibly as to make wilderness designation impos~ible. Though  unavailable to aboriginal peoples, the wilderness ideal is critical today.  

The need for sustainable development on agricullural lands does nol prejudice the need for wildemes..~. nor does wilderness.~ de5ignation lead  to complacency about sustainable development. Baird Callicott's nondi5Criminating account of humans 3., entirely natural is a metaphy5ical  confusion. Coupled with his anthropogenic value theory, the outcome operationally will be inadequate respect for intrinsic natural values. 



Revisiting the wilderness, Callicott (1991) is a doubtful  guide; indeed he has gotten himself lost. That is a pity.  because he is on the right track about sustainable develop- ment and I readily endorse his positive arguments for devel- oping a culture more hannonious with nature. BUlthese givc  no cause for being negative about wilderness.  The wilderness concept, we are told, is "inherently nawed:'  triply so. It metaphysically and unscientifically dichotomizes  man and nature. It is cthnocentric, because it does not realize  that practically all the world's ecosystems were modified by  aboriginal peoples. It is static, ignoring change through time.  In the flawed idea and ideal, wilderness respects wild com- munities where man is a visitor who does not remain. In the  revisited idea(I), also Leopold's ideal, humans. themselves  entirely natuml, reside in and can and ought to improve wild  nature.
