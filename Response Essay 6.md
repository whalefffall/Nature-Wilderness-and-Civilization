In this paper, the author illustrates the opportunities and challenges  of integrating wilderness components and processes into  the urban green infrastructure, in order to reconnect cities with nature. This paper mainly answers three questions: How to define wilderness in urban environment? Why is it promising to promote urban wilderness? What are the challenges and opportunities of living with urban wilderness?

**The main argument**

Wilderness design in urban environment is a hot topic in landscape design industry and has a future development. Wilderness varies greatly in its origin or ecology (ancient or novel), in its scale (from small plots to large areas), and in the extent to which natural processes determine the state of ecosystems (from inception to mature forest). Therefore, recognizing the specific characteristics and opportunities of the site is the key to its undeveloped development. In addition to preserving completely undisturbed wilderness, appropriate design interventions are also feasible. Local community involvement in protecting, developing or regulating urban wilderness areas is also an effective approach. Ultimately, elevating wilderness in urban green infrastructure promises to reconnect people with the natural world and preserve urban biodiversity.

**Thought of argumentation**

First of all, this paper clarifies the research object and answers the question of what is the wilderness in the city. Based on the concept of wilderness in nature conservation, the author emphasizes that wilderness is established on the basis of a highly self-regulating ecosystem process without obvious human interference. From the level of typology, the urban wilderness areas are divided into ancient wilderness and new wilderness, which correspond to the traditional concept of wilderness in nature conservation, and ecosystems developed in the Anthropocene under profound human influence on soil, hydrological conditions, or species communities.

Secondly, the author discusses the reasons for the research and answers the prospect of improving the urban wilderness. Preserving or enhancing old and new wilderness in cities can help address the global biodiversity crisis. Providing urban dwellers with greater access to nature benefits human health and well-being. The integration of new wilderness and urban green infrastructure can help improve urban resilience, especially in the face of climate change. The new urban wilderness is the common product of nature and culture. Especially when it is interwoven with architectural relics, it can make people understand and remember the vicissitudes of urban land.

Finally, the author returns to the research topic and explores the opportunities and challenges of living with wilderness. The author makes a classification discussion. For vast old wilderness sites, the necessary landscape design interventions are needed to ensure accessibility within the natural landscape and to preserve and restore it. For the new wilderness site, it is usually necessary to design intervention to integrate it with urban green infrastructure, improve people's negative cognition of the new wilderness, and adjust the vegetation dynamics in some areas. For the wilderness element in the traditional green space, it is also feasible to enhance the wilderness element in the urban space to help the city rewilding.

**My opinion**

From the perspective of landscape design, the author systematically discusses the prospects and challenges of urban wilderness. In addition to the wilderness in traditional nature conservation, the author also focuses on the new wilderness which is gradually replaced by nature due to the reduction of human influence. These are usually abandoned areas in the city, which can be treated and utilized to make the city glow with new vitality. As a computer student, we often delete the useless files in the computer directly to release the memory, but the reality is not simple and unchanged electronic data, to be used often can turn waste into treasure. In fact, there is also the idea in machine learning that you can build on a less effective model and iterate over it to get a better model.
