> To experience the world in terms of something more than immediate stimuli (that is, things to eat, things to avoid, things to be done) is already on the way to spirituality. But spirituality also requires the critical question, “Why?” It requires a sense of the future and of the significance of the past. It requires a recognition of death (one’s own and of others), and consequently of the contingency and preciousness of life. It requires an awareness of the tragic, of the awful possibilities that face and eventually befall us. It requires a keen conception of self, not just consciousness or mere awareness but self-consciousness and self-reflection, the impulse toward “an examined life.”



> Spirituality, I said, is a larger sense of life. It means that we see beyond ourselves, first to other people and then to nature as spirit and as spiritual. Many philosophers have insisted that we should not view others as mere means to our ends, but this is not just an ethical maxim, a matter of duty



> One of the themes that I want to pursue in this book is the idea that spirituality is neither rational nor emotional but both at once, both Apollonian and Dionysian, as Nietzsche would say. Spirituality is living beyond oneself, discovering a larger self or, what amounts to almost the same thing, achieving what the Buddhists and Taoists refer to as “no self.” Believing in God, not as an abstract proposition but as a personally enriching experience, is one way of being spiritual. But being in love, losing oneself in great music, feeling oneself at one with nature, these are others. Hegel, raised a Lutheran but arguably a closet atheist, defined spirituality as the recognition of the world and ourselves as Spirit, and using this cosmic personification he found spirituality everywhere. Nietzsche, also raised a Lutheran but a militant atheist, expressed far more spirituality in his warrior philosophy than did the sham Christians he criticized. What made Nietzsche an archetype of spiritual self-realization was his celebration of his own life (though it was not a happy one) with irony and humor, accepting and even loving his fate (what he called “amor fati”). What opposes spirituality is not naturalism, or secularism, or even materialism, but petty egoism, vanity, and vulgarity.
