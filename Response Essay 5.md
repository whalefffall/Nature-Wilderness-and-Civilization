In this paper, the authors use text analysis and field interview method, take Dangjia village as an example, analyze the relationship between the village, the ancestral culture and the local  emotions, analyze the changes of ancestor worship behavior and the reasons behind, and explore the road of rural revitalization.

**The main argument**

With the development of market-oriented economy, the public space for ancestor worship gradually disappeared, the main body of ancestor worship changed from collective to individual, and the ancestor worship ceremony also changed from complex to simple. Its essence is the decline of Chinese traditional culture and the weakening of local emotional attachment. In particular, ancestral cultures have been broken and disappeared. People's rural complex and local attachment become more and more indifferent, which has a great impact on the development of the whole village and society. With the rise of rural revival and the revival of rural civilization, the local attachment and local complex of traditional culture is still one of the soul and support of rural development. Therefore, to find and restore the lost local emotion is the fundamental measure of rural revitalization, is the inevitable process of the construction of a new socialist countryside. With the expansion of the research vision of rural revitalization, the return of local feelings will become a hot topic.

**Thought of argumentation**

In the introduction part of this paper, local emotion is first introduced. Its carriers include symbols such as village layout and ancestral hall in physical space and spiritual space. Furthermore, relevant researches at home and abroad are introduced. Foreign researches focus on the emotional experience brought by rural places, while domestic researches focus more on material changes. The second part discusses the connotation of ancestral culture, from text analysis to correlation analysis, from shallow to deep analysis of the material space of ancestral culture, spiritual space representative. The third part tells the reason for choosing the location -- through text analysis, it is found that Dangjia Village is represented by traditional culture, and the relevant literature and materials are very rich. The fourth part analyzes the change of ancestor worship emotion from the village, which can be reflected in the reduction of the importance of ancestral hall and the change of ancestor worship ceremony from complex to simple. The fifth part analyzes the reasons for the decline of the emotional value of ancestor worship, including the transformation of production relations under the impact of urbanization, the disintegration of rural social structure, the destruction of the original rural spatial layout and other reasons. The carrier of ancestor worship emotion is reduced, and the social background of this emotion is gradually changing, so this emotion is constantly weakened. The sixth part introduces the strategy of making local emotion return. To maintain the media, we should not only build material places, but also emphasize ancestor worship ceremonies and carry forward ancestral feelings. Finally, summarize the previous article. 

In this paper, the context is clear, from the shallow to the deep, tracing to the source, and put forward the solution strategy to the weakening of local emotion.

**My opinion**

The important means of analysis in this paper is text analysis. Through this modern means, we can quickly understand the previous research, and carry out our own new research based on it. The argument is advanced layer by layer and combined with the reality, which is very convincing. Personally, I think it is very necessary to return to the local emotion. After all, in our traditional culture, we pay great attention to tracing the roots. "One should not forget his roots" is also the characteristic of Chinese traditional culture. Of course, this local emotion should be in line with the development of today's society, neither blindly maintaining the original rules nor abandoning the original customs. The choice between them is very need to be considered.
